# 🧬 OOP Pillar: Inheritance

## 📖 What is Inheritance?

In everyday life, **inheritance** often refers to traits passed from parents to offspring. In **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, inheritance is a core principle that allows one class (a *child* or *subclass*) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (a *parent* or *superclass*).

## 🐾 Example Without Inheritance

We begin with two classes:

```python
class Dog:
  def bark(self):
    print('Woof!')

class Cat:
  def meow(self):
    print('Meow!')
```

Each class has a unique behavior, but what if both animals need a common action like `eat()`? Repeating the method in both classes would be inefficient and repetitive.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Using Inheritance to Avoid Repetition

We introduce a parent class `Animal` that contains the shared method:

```python
class Animal:
  def eat(self):
    print("Nom Nom Nom...eating food!")
```

Now, `Dog` and `Cat` can inherit from `Animal`:

```python
class Dog(Animal):
  def bark(self):
    print('Bark!')

class Cat(Animal):
  def meow(self):
    print('Meow!')
```

## 🧪 Inheritance in Action

```python
fluffy = Dog()
zoomie = Cat()

fluffy.eat()  # Output: Nom Nom Nom...eating food!
zoomie.eat()  # Output: Nom Nom Nom...eating food!
```

Both instances can now use the `eat()` method defined in the `Animal` class.

## ✅ Advantages of Inheritance

- **Code Reusability**: Avoid duplicating methods across related classes.
- **Logical Structure**: Create hierarchical relationships between general and specific classes.
- **Maintainability**: Make updates to shared behavior in a single place (the parent class).

Inheritance simplifies code and enhances organization, making it a fundamental tool in building scalable object-oriented systems.
