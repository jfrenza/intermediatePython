# 🧠 Python Concepts Summary Repository

Welcome! This repository contains concise and structured summaries of fundamental Python programming concepts, organized by theme for easier learning and reference.

Each folder corresponds to a **specific topic** in Python and includes **short, well-explained summaries** extracted from interactive coding lessons. This repo serves as a **quick reference** and **revision aid** for beginners and intermediate learners.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `function_arguments/`  
  Summaries covering different types of function arguments in Python:
  - Positional Arguments
  - Keyword Arguments
  - Default Arguments
  - Variable-length Arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`)

  Explains how Python handles variable names internally using namespaces:
  - Built-in Namespace
  - Global Namespace
  - Local Namespace
  - Enclosing Namespace

- `scope/`  
  Describes how Python determines variable visibility across different parts of the code:
  - What scope is and how it works
  - The relationship between scope and namespaces
  - LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in)
  - **Local Scope**
  - **Enclosing (Nonlocal) Scope**
  - **Use of the `nonlocal` keyword**
  - **Global Scope**
  - **Use of the `global` keyword**

- `functions_deep_dive/`  
  A deeper exploration of key function-related topics in Python:
  - **Lambda Functions**
  - **Higher-Order Functions**
  - **Decorators**

- `oop/`  
  Covers the **Object-Oriented Programming** paradigm in Python:
  - **Introduction to OOP**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Polymorphism**
  - **Dunder Methods** and Operator Overloading
  - **Abstraction** (using abstract base classes)
  - **Encapsulation** (public, protected, and private members)
